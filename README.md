# ContainerPractice
## Why?
I want to learn how the STL containers work under the hood. This is simply an educational project and not meant to be used for serious work nor is it meant to be optimized. Although I may employ the use of the containers written in this library in other projects to brag about how I didn't use STL and minimized dependencies :)
